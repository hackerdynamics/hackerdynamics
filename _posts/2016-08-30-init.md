I've waited too long for this.

I've been sitting on this domain for a while now hoping that the time would be gifted to me so that I could get everything perfect. While I waited, the [slack channel](http://hackerdynamics.slack.com) got setup, [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hackerdynamics/) got setup, email got setup and as my son would say "and a bunch of other stuff", but this site never got built. I've decided to just deploy and will improve things as we go. My apologies in advance for breaking changes.

It's time to heat of the soldering irons, get the community together, and boot up our IDEs. It's time to start committing the code, creating the eagle files, and buying the materials. It's time.

I've waited too long; let's go!
